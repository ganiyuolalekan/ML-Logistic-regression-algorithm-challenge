# ML-Logistic-regression-algorithm-challenge

Data Science Nigeria (DSN) open challenge on implementing a Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch using Python or R programming.


## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary.  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## Implemetation

The Logistic Regression algorithm was implemented with python using jupyter notebook. 

The iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris() was used to test the speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Unlike the default iris dataset, my implementation modified it to match the binary requirement of the logistic regression algorithm. Given that the algorithm (Logistic Algorithm) is a Binary Classification Algorithm.

L2 Regularization (Euclidean Normal) was also implemented to optimize the algorithm, obtaining same accuracy in fewer iterations as it would have been for longer iterations.
